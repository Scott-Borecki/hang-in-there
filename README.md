**[Hang In There](https://scott-borecki.github.io/hang-in-there/)** is a simple web application that uses JavaScript to dynamically generate motivational posters from a collection of random images, titles, and quotes.

A user is able to save their favorite posters and can also create their own!

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Learning Goals

- Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data
- Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Personal Reflections

I completed this project as part of my personal journey through the open-source Front-End Engineering curriculum of [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/).  

This was the first [web application](https://scott-borecki.github.io/hang-in-there/) that I developed using JavaScript to dynamically manipulate the DOM and store information within the Data Model.  Through this project, I got a light introduction to JavaScript's flavor of object-oriented programming.  Other personal areas of exploration included getting more familiar with query selectors, event listeners, and event handlers.  There are so many options!

I am very proud of what I was able to accomplish in this project.  One area that I would like to focus on is getting more familiar with the [JavaScript MDN Web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).  I feel like the docs are a great resource; however, I need to get a better understanding of the inner workings of JavaScript to really be able to use the docs effectively.  That said, I was able to leverage the docs and my googling abilities to work through blockers along the way.
